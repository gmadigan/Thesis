The muon system \cite{MuonTDR} is responsible for recording the momenta of muons in the outer-most layer of CMS. As muons provide a clean signature in many physics analyses, obtaining high-resolution measurements of muon momenta is critical. It is comprised of four separate technologies that provide redundancy in both the barrel and endcap regions. The subsystems are the Drift Tubes (DTs) in the barrel, the Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) and in the endcap regions, the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in both the barrel and endcaps, and as of Run 3, the Gas Electon Multipliers (GEMs) located at the outer-most layer of the endcaps. Each subsytem uses a different technology and records muon hits separetly, with reconstruction combining the information from all the subsytems. The muon barrel (MB) system is divided into four concentric shells, or stations, in each of the five wheels of the CMS barrel, labeled from inner-most to outer-most (along the $r$-coordinate): MB1, MB2, MB3, and MB4. Similarly, the muon endcap (ME) system is arranged into four disks in both the plus and minus endcaps, also called stations, labeled from inner-most to outer-most (along the $z$-coordinate): ME$\pm$1, ME$\pm$2, ME$\pm$3, and ME$\pm$4 ($\pm$ of course identifies the plus or minus endcap). Figure~\ref{fig:MuonSystem} shows a diagram including each subsytem and the pseudorapidity coverage of the muon system.
