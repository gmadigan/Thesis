To meet the wide-ranging goals expected by the LHC physics program, the CMS detector \cite{CMSTDR} was installed at insertion point 5 (P5) along the LHC ring, and records the proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC. The distinguishing feature of the CMS detector is a powerful superconducting solenoid magnet. Hermetic in coverage and cylindrical in geometry, the CMS detector is divided into three subsystems: the inner tracker, the hadronic and electomagnetic calorimeters, and the muon system. A two-level trigger system is responsible for rejecting uninteresting physics events to reduce the storage size of the collision data. A diagram of the CMS detector is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMSDiagram}.

Data-taking periods of LHC experiments are grouped into years-long runs, separated by long shutdowns (LS) where important upgrades to the detectors are made. Run 1 saw CMS begin data-taking at $\sqrt{s}=\SI{7}{TeV}$ in 2010, co-discovering the Higgs boson in 2012, before ramping down in 2013 for two years of upgrades in LS1. Following LS1, CMS started recording $\sqrt{s}=\SI{13}{TeV}$ collisions durring Run 2 (2015-2018). LS2 saw more upgrades, and in 2022 CMS began Run 3.
