The Muon POG recommends corrections to trigger efficiencies. Efficiencies are measured using Tag \& Probe and compared to independently obtained effeciencies using orthogonal datasets. The latter method measures the efficiency of HLT in the primary MET datasets and in boosted \WJETS MC (for 2016) or mass-binned \HepProcess{\PW^* \to \Pmu\Pnu} MC (for 2017 and 2018). For \pseudorap-dependent scale factors, MC are reweighted to match the muon \pt distributions in the MET datasets. The central values for scale factors are taken from the Tag \& Probe method, while the uncertainties are estimated from the relative difference with the MET method. For the Tag \& Probe measurements, tags and probes follow the same criteria as when measuring ID efficiency, with the additional requriement that probes satisfy the high-\pt ID selection. Passing probes must be matched to objects fired by the HLT paths listed in Table~\ref{tab:muonhlt}. Scale factors are measured separately for each year and are binned in \pt at 52, 55, 60, 120, 200, 300, 500, and $> \SI{500}{\GeV}$ and binned in \pseudorap at $< 0.9$, 0.9, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.4.

HLT efficiency scale factors for high-\pt muons are measured by the Muon POG~\cite{MUO-17-001}\cite{AN-18-008}. The values are provided in a table (along with each scale factor's statistical and systematic uncertainty) on the TWiki pages in Refs.~\cite{MuonTwiki2016}\cite{MuonTwiki2017}\cite{MuonTwiki2018}. Per-muon HLT efficiency scale factors \SF{HLT}{\PmuOne} and \SF{HLT}{\PmuTwo} are converted to a per-event scale factor \SF{HLT}{event} by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
  \SF{HLT}{event} = 1-\left(1-\SF{HLT}{\PmuOne}\right)\left(1-\SF{HLT}{\PmuTwo}\right)
\end{equation}
