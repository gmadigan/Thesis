Power loss in mid-2018 saw HCAL loose the function of two wedges, HEM 15 and 16, which remained dead for the duration of the year. Data have been studied to identify any effect from the HEM 15/16 failure, detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:HEMFailure}, and no significant impact has been observed. No corrections related to the HEM 15/16 failure are applied.
