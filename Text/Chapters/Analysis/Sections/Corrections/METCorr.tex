Following the recommendations of the JME POG, Type-1 corrections are applied to MET, which propogate the JECs listed in Tables~\ref{tab:DataJEC} and~\ref{tab:MCJEC} to MET. JER smearing is propogated to MET in MC only. Type-1 corrections replace the vector \pt sum of particles which can be clustered by the vector \pt sum of JES- or JER-corrected jets and propogate the changes to MET.
