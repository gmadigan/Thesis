b-Jet identification and non-b-jet misidentification efficiencies can differ between data and MC. To account for these differences, corrections need to be applied to each event in simulation. Per-jet scale factors that are flavor-, \pt-, and \pseudorap-dependent are measured by the BTV POG. Several recommendations for combining these per-jet scale factors into a per-event weight $w$ exist and are described by the BTV POG on the Twiki page in Ref.~\cite{BTagSF}. As this analysis only considers b-tagging on the two leading jets, a method that does not demand measuring the b-jet identification efficiencies in MC can be used. The perscription is as follows: for an event with $n$ b-jets, given the requirement that there is at least one b-jet in the event, the event weight is

\begin{equation}
  w(\geq1|n) = 1-w(0|n),
\end{equation}

where $w(0|n)$ is the weight for events with $n$ b-jets, given the requirement that there are at least zero b-jets in the event, defined as

\begin{equation}
  w(0|n) = \prod^{n}_{i=1}(1-\text{SF}_i).
\end{equation}

where $i$ indexes the b-jets in the event and SF$_i$ is the scale factor for b-jet $i$. The BTV POG recommended scale factors used in this analysis are listed in Table~\ref{tab:btagsf} and are availible on the Twiki pages in Refs.~\cite{BtagTwiki2016}\cite{BtagTwiki2017}\cite{BtagTwiki2018}. The scale factors are added to MC samples in NanoAOD post-processing.
