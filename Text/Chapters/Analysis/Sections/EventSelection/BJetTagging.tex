To target leptoquark decays in the \mumubj channel, we identify jets originating from bottom quarks using the DeepJet discriminator~\cite{DeepJet}. DeepJet is a multiclass jet-flavor-tagging algorithm that uses deep learning and exploits low-level features from a high number of jet constituants. A total of 650 input variables are used to train the DeepJet algorithm, broken into four categories: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Global variables: including jet kinematics, the number of tracks in a jet, the number of secondary verticies in a jet, and  the number of reconstructed primary vertices in an event
    \item Charged PF candidate features: 16 features including track kinematics, track fit quality, displacement, and displacement uncertainty with respect to the PV, considering the 25 leading-displacement-significance candidates.
    \item Neutral PF candidate features: similar information to charged PF candidates.
    \item Secondary vertex information: 12 variables, such as flight distance significance, of up to four secondary verticies.
\end{itemize}

Performance-wise, it far exceeds the b-jet identification efficiency of the CMS b-tagger DeepCSV at every misidentification benchmark, with as much as a \SI{20}{\%} increase in efficiency at a \SI{0.1}{\%} misidentification rate (for jets with $\pt > \SI{90}{\GeV}$), making DeepJet a suitible choice of b-jet discriminator for this analysis. The DeepJet discriminator is availible in NanoAOD v7.

The B Tag \& Vertexing (BTV) POG recommends the use of loose, medium, or tight working points to identify b-jets, defined as b-jet misidentification rates of \SI{10}{\%}, \SI{1}{\%}, and \SI{0.1}{\%}, respectively~\cite{BTagID}. This analysis uses the medium working point and corresponds to a \SI{75}{\%} b-jet identification efficiency. The cut values on the DeepJet b tag discriminator corresponding to the medium working point in years 2016, 2017, and 2018 are, respectively: 0.3093, 0.3033, and 0.2770, availible on the Twiki pages in Refs.~\cite{BtagTwiki2016}\cite{BtagTwiki2017}\cite{BtagTwiki2018}. We require at least one b-jet in every event, where b-jet candidates are the two leading jets defined in Section~\ref{sec:Preselection}.
