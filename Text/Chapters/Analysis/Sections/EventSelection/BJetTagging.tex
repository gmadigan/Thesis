To target leptoquark decays in the \mumubj channel, we identify jets originating from bottom quarks using the DeepJet discriminator~\cite{DeepJet}. DeepJet is a multiclass jet flavor tagging algorithm that uses deep learning and exploits low-level features from a high number of jet constituants. Performance-wise, it far exceeds the b-jet identification efficiency of the CMS b-tagger DeepCSV at every misidentification benchmark, with as much as a \SI{20}{\%} increase in efficiency at a \SI{0.1}{\%} misidentification rate (for jets with $\pt > \SI{90}{\GeV}$), making DeepJet a suitible choice of b-jet discriminator for this analysis. The DeepJet discriminator is availible in NanoAOD v7.

The B Tag \& Vertexing (BTV) POG recommends the use of loose, medium, or tight working points to identify b-jets, defined as b-jet misidentification rates of \SI{10}{\%}, \SI{1}{\%}, and \SI{0.1}{\%}, respectively~\cite{BTagID}. This analysis uses the medium working point. The cut values on the DeepJet b tag discriminator corresponding to the medium working point in years 2016, 2017, and 2018 are, respectively: 0.3093, 0.3033, and 0.2770, availible on the Twiki pages in Refs.~\cite{BtagTwiki2016}\cite{BtagTwiki2017}\cite{BtagTwiki2018}. We require at least one b-jet in every event, where b-jet candidates are the two leading jets defined in Section~\ref{sec:Preselection}.
