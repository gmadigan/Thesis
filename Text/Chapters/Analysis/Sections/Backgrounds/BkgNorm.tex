The \ZJETS, \ttbar, diboson, and \TTV processes are modeled via the same approach: MC simulation is used to first estimate the background shape, then the background is normalized to data at preselection with scale factors extracted inside a high sample purity CR. The CR used for \ZJETS normalization is the \PZ-enriched mass window $80 < \Muu < \SI{100}{\GeV}$ (the \PZ mass-pole), referred to as region A. The \ZJETS normalization scale factors are also parameterized in bins of jet multiplicity. For normalizing \ttbar, a CR orthogonal to region A is used: the \ttbar-enriched mass window $100 < \Muu < \SI{100}{\GeV}$ (the top quark kinematic turn-on), referred to as region B. Diboson and \TTV backgrounds are normalized simultaneously in the same CR within the mass window $80 < \Muu < \SI{100}{\GeV}$, referred to as region C. While regions A and C share a mass window, region C also inverts the veto on a third lepton into a requirement that there are at least three leptons and is thus orthogonal to both regions A and B, and to retain sufficient statistics the b-jet tag requirement is dropped. The sample purity of the orthogonal regions A, B, and C were verified, being either \PZ-, \ttbar-, or \VV- and \TTV-enriched in the respective CRs. The normalization scale factors \RZ, \RTT, and \RVV are defined by:

\begin{equation}
       \RZ = \frac{\NCR{A}{Data} - \RTT\NCR{A}{\ttbar} - \NCR{A}{\VV} - \NCR{A}{\TTV} - \NCR{A}{O}}{\NCR{A}{\PZ}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
       \RTT = \frac{\NCR{B}{Data} - \RZ\NCR{B}{\PZ} - \NCR{B}{\VV} - \NCR{B}{\TTV} - \NCR{B}{O}}{\NCR{B}{\ttbar}},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
       \RVV = \frac{\NCR{C}{Data} - \RZ\NCR{C}{\PZ} - \RTT\NCR{C}{\ttbar} - \NCR{C}{O}}{\NCR{C}{\VV} + \NCR{C}{\TTV}},
\end{equation}

where \Nevents{Data} is the number of data events, \Nevents{X} is the number of X-process SM background events, and \Nevents{O} is the number of events produced by ``other'' SM processes (i.e., single top and \WJETS), while the superscripts A, B, and C respectively denote the \PZ, \ttbar, and \VV/\TTV CRs from which these event counts are extracted. Due to the codependency of \RZ, \RTT, and \RVV, their values are initialized to unity, and the normalization factors are iteratively computed until the factors are stable. There is a strong dependence of the normalization scale factor in the \ZJETS background on the number of reconstructed jets, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:znjets}, so a jet-multiplicity-binned \ZJETS is used. The \ttbar background shows no such dependence. The scale factors and their uncertainties are listed for each year in Tables~\ref{tab:znormsf}-\ref{tab:vvnormsf}.

Studies on the stability of the background normalization scale factors can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:SFStudy}.

Observed and expected \Muu distributions at preselection are shown in Figs.~\ref{figapp:preselmasszoom} and~\ref{figapp:preselmasszoomcombined} that are zoomed into the respective CRs. Two representative signal MC samples are shown as well, with the normalization described in Section~\ref{sec:SimSignal}.
