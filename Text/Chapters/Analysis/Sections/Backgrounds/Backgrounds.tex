At preselection, the expected SM processes in the \mumubj channel that are considered are \ZJETS, \ttbar, diboson, \TTV, single top, and \WJETS. The most dominant processes, \ZJETS, \ttbar, diboson, and \TTV are estimated with MC simulation and renormalized to data using high-purity control regions (CR). The remaining background processes---single top and \WJETS---are taken directly from MC simulation.
