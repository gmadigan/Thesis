Agreement between observed data and SM expectation is found in each year of data-taking, illustrated with the kinematic distributions shown at preselection in Figures~\ref{figapp:vertex}--\ref{figapp:preselbtag}. The combination of data from all three years is provided in Figures~\ref{fig:vertexCombined}--\ref{fig:preselbtagCombined}. In all preselection plots,\ZJETS and \ttbar MC are normalized to data as explained in Section~\ref{sec:BkgNorm}, while the other background MC samples are normalized to the expected number of events (Section~\ref{sec:SimBackground}). Two representative signal MC samples are shown as well ($\MLQ = 1500$ and \SI{2000}{\GeV}), each normalizated to the expected number of events (Section~\ref{sec:SimSignal}). All events must satisfy the b-jet tag requirement from Section~\ref{sec:BJetTagging}, and signal and background events have been corrected according to Section~\ref{sec:Corrections}. The kinematic distributions plotted, most of which are inputs to the final selection, include the momenta and spatial separation of final state objects, invariant masses, MET, object multiplicities, and DeepJet b tag scores. Additionally, we define a few variables that are either arcane or unique to this analysis. The kinematic \ST is the scalar sum of the \pt of the four final state objects:

\begin{equation}
       \ST = \pt(\PmuOne) + \pt(\PmuTwo) + \pt(\PjOne) + \pt(\PjTwo).
\end{equation}

The leptoquark candidates, identified as muon-jet invariant masses \MujOne and \MujTwo, are defined as the muon-jet pairings that minimize the absolute difference between the two masses, with \MujOne being the larger mass:

\begin{equation}
       \mathrm{min}\left( | \MujOne - \MujTwo | \right), \MujOne > \MujTwo
\end{equation}

The kinematics we have defined---\ST, \MujOne and \MujTwo---are particularly strong signal/background discriminators, making them indespensible variables to the final selection, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:FinalSelection}.
