Many observed phenomena are conspicuously absent in the SM, confirming that while self-consistent, the SM is ultimately an incomplete theory. The gravitational force; the matter composition of the universe (including dark matter and dark energy); the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe; and massive, oscillating neutrinos, to name a few, all lack any prediction in the SM. Attempts to model these phenomena within the paradigm of QFT and merge them with the SM are often called extensions to the SM or beyond the SM theories. Some extensions to the SM, such as Grand Unification~\cite{gut1}\cite{gut2}, Technicolor~\cite{techni1}\cite{techni2}\cite{techni3}, composite models, and Supersymmetry~\cite{superstring}, require a new boson that would uniquely carry both baryon number $B$ and lepton number $L$, generically called a leptoquark (symbolically, \LQ). Such a boson would mediate quark-lepton transitions and answer many of the questions left in the SM, such as the remarkable symmetry of the quark and lepton generations.
