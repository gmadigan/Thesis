The leptoquark search detailed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:LeptoquarkSearch} considers only pair-produced scalar leptoquarks that couple to a bottom quark and muon, but is otherwise model independent. These search parameters constrain $\lambda_G$ and $\kappa_G$ to zero, $\beta$ to unity, and keeps the search insensitive to $\lambda$, leaving $M_{\LQ}$ the only search variable. Previous limits on leptoquark masses~\cite{CMSLQ2_2019} motivate a mass scan of 30 points ranging from 300~GeV to 4000~GeV. This search is the first leptoquark search with muons in the final state to analyze the entire LHC Run II dataset collected by CMS and the first ever search for the process $\LQ\LQ\rightarrow\mu\mu bb$ by CMS.
