Localized excitations, or quanta, of the quantum fields in the SM are called elementary particles. Particles are observed either directly or indirectly through experiment and carry intrinsic properties that distinguish them from one another, such as electric charge, mass, and quantum numbers like spin. Every particle has a corresponding antiparticle, which, roughly speaking, is identical to the particle save for its carrying an opposite-signed charge. All SM particles (and antiparticles) can be classified as either fermions or bosons, depending on their spin quantum number, detailed below in Sections~\ref{sec:Fermions} and~\ref{sec:Bosons}. Provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:SM} is a diagram of all the particles in the SM, practically organized, and includes a number of important properties for each; this diagram may be used as a map of the theory described in the following Sections.
