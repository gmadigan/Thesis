The prevailing description of nature at the fundamental level is a relativistic quantum field theory called the Standard Model (SM). Developed in the latter half of the 20th century, the SM has seen extraordinary success in its predictive power and is widely considered the most rigorously tested physical theory. The characteristics of the SM proceed from symmetries embedded in the Lagrangian of the theory. At the heart of the SM are the local gauge transformations associated with the gauge group product: 
\begin{equation}
    \SUthreeC \times \SUtwoW \times \UoneY,
\end{equation}
where the subscript on each gauge group identifies an associated conserved quantity: color charge C, weak isospin W, and weak hypercharge Y (all detailed in Section~\ref{sec:Forces}), which generate three of the four fundamental forces of nature (electromagnetic, weak, and strong; gravity is absent in the SM). Adding a collection of 17 quantized fields (by one way of counting) that respect this symmetry completes the SM. Experiments have revealed that the constituant building blocks of the universe are point-like particles, understood in the SM as excitations in the quantum fields, with each observed ``matter'' particle corresponding to an excitation in one of 12 fields, listed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:Particles}. Interactions among particles by the three fundamental forces are understood as the exchange of ``virtual'' particles, excitations in one of four fields, reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:Forces}. The remaining field corresponds to the Higgs particle and is responsible for the masses of the other particles, explained in Section~\ref{sec:Higgs}.
