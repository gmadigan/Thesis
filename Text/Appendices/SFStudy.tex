To determine if systematic uncertainties need to be accounted for in the \ZJETS and \ttbar normalization scale factors listed in Section~\ref{sec:BkgNorm}, each scale factor is studied, binned in \ST, \ptof{\PmuOne}, and \ptof{\jetOne}. The study was repeated for each year of data-taking, as shown in Figs.~\ref{figapp:sfstudy_2016}--\ref{figapp:sfstudy_2018}.

Also studied was the stability of the normalization scale factors with and without topPt reweighting. Shown in Figs.~\ref{figapp:sfstudy_st}--\ref{figapp:sfstudy_jetPt} are the comparisons without (left) and with (right) topPt reweighting. We in general see a better stability of the normalization scale factors after applying the topPt reweighting.

To ensure that systematic uncertainties originating from single top, W+Jets, \TTV, and diboson MC do not translate to the Z+Jets and \ttbar normalization scale factors, the ``other'' background simulations were varied $\SI{\pm20}{\%}$. Even with these variations, the background normalization scale factors agree within their errors. Table~\ref{tab:sfvariations} lists the background scale factors given each variation of the ``other'' backgrounds.
